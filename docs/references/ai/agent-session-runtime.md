# Agent Session Runtime

## Purpose

Agent-session streams need a stable host for UI turns, persistence, live
inject, interrupt, and recovery. The host must not know whether the
underlying agent uses a long-lived process, a websocket, one HTTP request
per turn, or Claude Code's SDK `query`.

The boundary is:

- `AgentSessionRuntimeService` owns Cherry's UI/session lifecycle.
- `AgentSessionRuntimeDriver` owns the concrete agent-session runtime lifecycle.

Claude Code is the first driver. Its `query`, warm query, SDK input
queue, and `resume` handling are driver internals.

## Ownership

| Owner | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `AgentChatContextProvider` | Validates the agent session, persists the user row plus pending assistant row, and starts or injects through the runtime. |
| `AgentSessionRuntimeService` | Owns one runtime entry per session: current UI turn, pending UI queue, runtime connection, latest resume token, terminal listeners, persistence, and idle timer. |
| `AgentSessionRuntimeDriver` | Connects to one concrete agent implementation and exposes `send`, optional `interrupt`, `close`, and an event stream. |
| `AiStreamManager` | Keeps the normal topic stream contract: start, live inject, pause current runtime turn, and start the next runtime turn. |
| `AiService.streamText()` | Routes `request.runtime.kind === 'agent-session'` to `AgentSessionRuntimeService.openTurnStream()` and rejects agent-session topics that do not carry runtime metadata. |
| `ClaudeCodeRuntimeDriver` | Converts Claude SDK messages into generic runtime events and maps opaque resume tokens to Claude SDK `resume`. |

## Fresh turn

1. Renderer sends `Ai_Stream_Open` for topic `agent-session:<sessionId>`.
2. `AgentChatContextProvider` validates the session:
   - the session must have an agent and workspace;
   - the workspace path must pass `assertClaudeCodeWorkspaceDirectory`;
   - the agent type must have a registered runtime driver;
   - the agent must have a model.
3. The provider atomically saves:
   - a `user` message with the submitted parts;
   - a pending `assistant` message with the selected model id.
4. The provider calls `AgentSessionRuntimeService.beginTurn(...)`.
5. `beginTurn()` returns:
   - a `PendingMessageQueue` for later live injects;
   - a runtime persistence listener;
   - a runtime terminal listener;
   - a trace flush listener for `agent-session:${sessionId}` history files;
   - a `turnId`.
6. The prepared model request includes:
   - `runtime: { kind: 'agent-session', sessionId, turnId }`;
   - `pendingMessages`;
   - `messageId` set to the pending assistant row;
   - seed `messages`: the user row plus the empty assistant row.
7. `AiStreamManager` starts the execution. `AiService.streamText()`
   detects the runtime metadata and calls `openTurnStream()` instead of
   building a generic `Agent`.
8. `openTurnStream()` ensures there is a runtime connection and admits
   the turn by calling `connection.send({ message })`.

## Live inject

If the same topic already has a live stream, `AgentChatContextProvider`
does not create a new assistant placeholder and does not call
`beginTurn()` again. It only saves the new user message and returns a
request that lets `AiStreamManager.send()` take the inject path.

The manager pushes that user message into each execution's
`pendingMessages`. For agent-session executions, that queue is wired to
`AgentSessionRuntimeService.enqueueUserMessage()`.

The host then:

1. leaves the current turn alone while tool calls are active;
2. calls `connection.interrupt()` once the turn is safe to interrupt, if
   the driver supports it;
3. asks `AiStreamManager.pauseRuntimeTurn()` to terminalize the current
   UI turn;
4. starts the next UI turn from the pending queue.

This keeps the renderer protocol unchanged while each driver decides how
to interrupt its own runtime.

## Starting the next runtime turn

When a paused, aborted, or completed runtime turn still has pending user
messages, `AgentSessionRuntimeService.startNextTurn()`:

1. removes the next user message from the pending queue;
2. saves a new pending assistant row;
3. creates a fresh `turnId`;
4. calls `AiStreamManager.startRuntimeTurn(...)` with:
   - the same topic id;
   - the same runtime pending queue;
   - `runtime: { kind: 'agent-session', sessionId, turnId }`;
   - seed messages containing the user row and empty assistant row.

The runtime connection may stay on the entry. What that means is driver
specific: Claude Code keeps its SDK query/input queue, while another
driver could keep a websocket or reconnect per turn.

## Resume token persistence

Drivers may emit:

```ts
{ type: 'resume-token'; token: string }
```

The host treats the value as opaque. It stores it as
`entry.lastResumeToken` and passes `runtimeResumeToken` to
`AgentSessionMessageBackend`, so the final assistant row receives the
latest resume token at terminal time.

This also covers error turns: if a driver emitted a resume token and then
failed, the assistant error row still records that token so the next
connection can recover from the newest driver-known state.

User rows do not need a resume token. The durable recovery anchor is the
latest assistant row with `runtimeResumeToken`.

For Claude Code, the resume token is the SDK `session_id`. The driver
maps it to `options.resume`. This is separate from the SDK's file
checkpointing / `rewindFiles()` feature, which uses user-message UUIDs
to restore files.

## Claude Code driver

Normal multi-turn chat does not use `continue: true` and does not rely
on cwd-based session discovery.

When `ClaudeCodeRuntimeDriver.connect()` needs to create a query, it
asks `buildClaudeCodeQueryRequestForAgentSession(sessionId, resumeToken)`.
The builder uses the first available value:

1. explicit resume token from the host;
2. latest persisted agent-session resume token from
   `agentSessionMessageService.getLastRuntimeResumeToken(session.id)`;
3. no resume id for a brand-new SDK session.

The query may come from `ClaudeCodeWarmQueryManager.consume(...)` if a
prewarmed query is available. Otherwise the driver starts a new SDK
query with `createClaudeQuery({ prompt: driverSdkInputQueue, options })`.

The driver converts Claude SDK messages into runtime events:

- `stream_event` / assistant/user messages -> `chunk`;
- `system/init` -> `resume-token`;
- `result` -> `resume-token` and `turn-complete`;
- thrown errors -> `error`.

## Idle and shutdown

After a turn reaches terminal state, the runtime entry becomes `idle`.
For a short idle window it keeps:

- the runtime connection, if it is still alive;
- `lastResumeToken`;
- the session-level pending queue state.

If a new turn arrives during that window, `beginTurn()` reuses the same
entry and only swaps the current UI turn plus the UI pending queue.

When the idle timer expires, the runtime closes the entry:

- closes pending queues;
- closes the runtime connection;
- prewarms Claude Code when a latest resume token is known.

Service stop and destroy close all runtime entries.

## Removed old path

Claude Code is not a normal provider extension anymore:

- no `createClaudeCode`;
- no `ClaudeCodeLanguageModel`;
- no `ClaudeCodeProviderSettings`;
- no `injectedMessageSource` in provider settings;
- no `providerToAiSdkConfig(..., { runtimeResumeToken })` branch.

Any `agent-session:*` stream that reaches `AiService.streamText()`
without runtime metadata is rejected. That fail-fast rule prevents a
regression back to one CLI process per turn without the long-lived SDK
input queue inside the Claude Code driver.
