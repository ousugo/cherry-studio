"""Derive a new .xlsx/.docx by copying the original package and rewriting only
the XML parts the requested edits touch.

OOXML files are ZIP packages of XML parts. This script copies every part of
the original byte-for-byte and re-serializes only what an edit reaches: the
targeted part (one worksheet, or word/document.xml) and, for xlsx, the workbook
bookkeeping named below. Fidelity risk is confined to those.
The touched part is manipulated with xml.dom.minidom, which round-trips
namespace prefixes and declarations verbatim (unlike ElementTree, which
rewrites unknown prefixes and breaks mc:Ignorable references). The source
file is never modified. Standard library only — no dependencies.

Edit JSON shapes (pass via --edits):

    {"format": "xlsx", "sheet": "Sheet1", "cells": {"B2": 42, "C3": "hello", "D4": true}}
    {"format": "docx", "replacements": [{"paragraph": 3, "text": "new text"}]}

xlsx: each cell is overwritten with the JSON value (number, string, or
boolean); an ordinary formula in that cell is replaced by the value, while a
cell belonging to a shared, array, or data-table formula group is refused (see
reject_shared_formula and grouped_formula_ranges). The worksheet's <dimension>
is widened when edits create cells outside it. Any write also sets fullCalcOnLoad
on xl/workbook.xml (see request_full_recalc), and replacing a formula additionally
drops xl/calcChain.xml (see drop_calc_chain); those, plus [Content_Types].xml /
workbook.xml.rels, are the only parts besides the edited worksheet this script
ever rewrites.
docx: 'paragraph' is the zero-based ordinal among BODY-LEVEL paragraphs
(direct w:body children; tables excluded); the paragraph keeps its paragraph
style and the first run's character style, and extra run-level styling is
flattened into the new text. A paragraph holding anything the output shape
cannot carry is refused rather than silently stripped — see
reject_unrepresentable_content, which allow-lists what survives instead of
enumerating what is dangerous.

The output is written to a staging file and renamed on success, so a failure
never leaves a partial package behind (see atomic_output).
